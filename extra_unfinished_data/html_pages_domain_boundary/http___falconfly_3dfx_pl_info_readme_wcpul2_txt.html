                     WCPUL2.EXE    Version 1.6  for Win32
  /---------------------------------------------------------------------------/

   First
   ^^^^^
   This program is the device driver who has rewritten L2 cache Latency of
   Intel Pentium II, Pentium III, Pentium II Xeon, Celeron w/L2, to an
   optional value at the time of the OS starting.

   This program is the soft for a power user. Please pay attention because
   there be the possibility that OS stops triggering and introduce readily.

   Also, pay attention in the case that I exchange the CPU. It may not act
   normally, with the value of Latency that was setting up it until now,
   when it becomes the CPU that differs.

   Do the driver Uninstall, whether or not the Latency value is set up to an
   ineffective value (FFh recommendation) once.


   Target operating system
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   It runs on Windows 95/98 and Windows NT 4.0/5.0 in both Japanese and
   English mode. As for the driver for DOS, obtain special WCPUL2D.


   Automatic installation
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   Run InstDD.EXE, This program does the preparation of the copy of the
   drivers file and  make registry automatically.
   After re-starting the system, run WCPUL2.EXE and setup/check L2 Latency.
