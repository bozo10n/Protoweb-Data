<p><b>2024-11-20</b></p>
<p>Last night we had a major wind storm in the Pacific Northwest and we lost power
for 6 hours, which was great compared to what others in the area are still going through.
But that was no match for the small APC UPS which was holding up the PCjr and the
networking gear.  After an hour without power I shut the PCjr down to keep the
networking gear up longer.</p>

<p>The PCjr had over 1400 hours of continuous runtime on it, and this time it was
running without a hard drive.  All of the web pages were being served from a
network attached hard drive image served by a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W.  I think I can declare
the mTCP NetDrive code to be stable. ;-) </p>

<p>Stay well!<br>

<p>P.S.: Our property looks like it was hit with a Christmas tree shredder.  Now it is
clean-up time.</p>
