		<p><b>10/20/2024</b> - Introducing the Statistics page! Now you can see what game get's played often and what not! Also fixed the game icons in the Events page. Now you can see the game's name when you hover over the icons.</p>

		<p><b>10/19/2024</b> - Work on the game pages and other neat features may continue development sometime in November. But in the meantime, I have released more guides covering a couple of guides that were previously on the old version of the website but were rewritten. There is also a new guide on setting up Unreal Tournament on modern hardware.</p>

		<p><b>10/18/2024</b> - Say Hello to the new DOSBox Deathmatch Club website! New branding, and everything. Also in the process of porting over some of the guides from the Discord server to this site aswell. The patches from the Discord to here will come soon, but I do have plans to implement more features like a page for each game. Stay tuned!</p>
