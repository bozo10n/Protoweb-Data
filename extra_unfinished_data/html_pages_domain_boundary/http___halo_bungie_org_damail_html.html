		<p class="mailentry">hey i am jimmy galpin i wasa wondering if i could get Recon armour becuase if u look at my gamertag and go to my fileshare u will see a video of me getting a awesome sniper double kill headshot with one bullet but whats funny is the bullet goes throught one guys helmet killing him and then bounces of it and kills a guy who just spawned diagnolly to the left of him.<br><br><span class="mailauthor">jimmygalpin</span></p>

my name is Lane Fritz my gamertag is ----------. Im a huge halo fan and I know you guys probably get thousands of these a day but I was wondering how I would be able to get a recon helmet or flaming head. Just wondering

		<p class="mailentry">I have read that you maybe award recon armour to people who kill people with traffic cones. On my profile (George Sinclair) i have successfully done this. Would it be possible to get the recon armour for this reason.
 
Yours sincerely<br><br><span class="mailauthor">George Sinclair</span></p>
		<p class="mailreply">You can't expect to be rewarded just for staging what some other guy already did by accident. Get a kill with <i>two</i> traffic cones and we'll talk.</p>

		<p class="mailentry">Hello my name is Mark and I am from Ohio, and by reading this you know i play your game Halo 3 and I probably play halo 3 too much. I have recently  found a glitch on High Ground, and if you find this to be helpful to you the only thing i would like to have in return if possible is Recon Armor. Ok now on High Ground you would start driving a mongoose from the outside area of the base into the tunnel where you can get the side entrance int the building if you drive the mongoose to that area where you gain entrance to the tunnel and just ram the mongoose into the wall and once you are in there you get off the mongoose and you will go through that wall, and you be by right next to the tunnel on the other side of the map<br><br><span class="mailauthor">IX Meatball XI( I's are i's)</span></p>

Thank you bungie.<br><br><span class="mailauthor">spencer byrd</span></p>
		<p class="mailreply">In my experience, the recon helmet tends to elicit breathing, muffled music, and semicoherent insults. It doesn't really seem like what you're looking for.</p>

		<p class="mailentry">Hello Bungie, My name is Dan Palermo and i am a huge fan of your game Halo CE. My friend had purchased the game on November 15th on it's release.  we stayed up all day and night playing the game on legendary and we played it till we beat it. I held halo party's at my house almost every other week. than when you had released the Halo CE figures I was hooked on getting ever figure that I could find, than when I had seen the Halo 2 trailer I just about died, I watched it over and over again and played Halo CE as often as i passably could.  on November 8th i got around 2 hours of sleep. after that on November 9th, of it's release i played all day, during school i almost felt sick because i wasn't playing it it took me exactly 3 days to beet, At the time i did not have Xbox live. but I made dew playing Campaign several times. ever since than i had purchased every Halo Item that I came Across. On the day of Halo 3's release I was there at the midnight launch party, I purchased the legendary addition and beat Halo 3 the vary first day. after that I purchased the Halo Actionclix Scarab, almost every Actionclix piece that was made, 8 halo T-shirts, 2 halo hoodies, 1 halo hat, at least 30 figures, the BR and Carbine replica, the Halo 3 Messenger Bag, The Halo 3 Xbox 360 carry case, the SPnKR case around 30 packs of the cards and well over 100 cans of the Halo Game Fuel. I think  that in the last 7 years of Halo being released I have ben a vary loyal fan to your game and i would vary much appreciate it if you could give me the EOB recon armor. 
 
      I hope to see much more come from from you guys and I will be there to buy almost all of your products, I guarantee you that when Halo Wars is released I will have it
 
I thank you for your time and keep up the Amazing work<br><br><span class="mailauthor">Phantom Darknes</span></p>
		<p class="mailreply">I was at the midnight launch, and I don't remember seeing you there before the party really got started. After that, the next thing I remember is waking up on the street outside the Best Buy with nothing but a copy of Halo 3 and a pounding headache. The game looked like it had been stepped on a few times, so I went to give their service desk a piece of my mind. All they gave me in return was muffled snickers from the salesmen, dirty looks from the janitors, and requests that I keep my voice down from everyone else. They eventually called me a cab. I think my breath was driving away customers.

Anyway, that throws your whole story into doubt. Sorry.</p>

		<p class="mailentry">Hi Bungie I'm Jorge Baez from Puerto Rico(that's in The Caribbean) I am 13 years old. First I want to said that I'm not very good with the english so I'm sorry if I write incorrect some words. So I just wanna said thank you, thank you for create ''The games of games'' ''The AssKicker'' that is ... <u><i>HALO</i></u>. Man, <u><i>HALO</i></u>  is the greatest game ever. I mean the graphics, game play, forge, theater, online games and others things. I'm a huge fan of <u><i>HALO</i></u>. I even wrote on one of my white underwear <u><i>HALO</i></u> <u>3</u> RULES. Nah just kidin. But seriously I am a huge fan of it. I buy the Legendary Edition maybe you said ''wow just the legendary'' but did you know how hard it is to tell my father ''hey <u><i>HALO</i></u> <u>3</u> is in the stores can you give $160 dollars so I can buy it'' man that hurt, but if its for <u><i>HALO</i></u>  I can even prostitute myself. Nah just kidding again, but really if it for <u><i>HALO</i></u> I wash cars so I have the money. But well thank God I have <u><i>HALO</i></u> in legendary edition. Well Bungie I hope you like my email and never quit you are the best company of games ever and don't feel bad if some people said that Call of Du... pardon me ''Cock of Duty'' is better than <u><i>HALO</i></u> that people is horseshit. And well with this I finish. And remember <u><i>HALO</i></u> KICK ASS now I'm gonna said it in spanish ''<u><i>HALO</i></u> PATEA LOS CULOS''  . Oh another thing if its not to much ask, can you give me RECON? that helmet rocks I have hayabusa but RECON is unique. My gamertag is KiNGiN 0852 and if you do not want to give me RECON just email me to --------@hotmail.com saying ''thank you for the email'' or whatever I will appreciate. Thank You for reading and continue kicking asses thanks and God bless Bungie. )=)

 P.S: If you want to make more money just go to Microsoft Word press the shift button and then 4 let it press and you will making $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ a lot of money jajajajaja gotcha.

		<p class="mailentry">Hi, its me Trainedrelic I'm a player who admires bugie and the triology of Halo 3. Also I'm more than satisfied with Halo 3 with the online and maps, unforunaly my xbox 360 broke abiut 3 weeks ago so i havent played fora long time. Also about Recon Armour that i really like it would be my dream to have it. I've been a Halo player since Halo Evolved Combat came out and have sucsessfuly beaten all 3 of them and I had a fun time, but Halo 3 took the cake for the best game ever! So in conclusion I would really appreciate if you came to a thought so you can give me the best armour Recon, because the first time I heard that recon was for bungie employes my happy face went sad. So what ever think even if this letter doen't come through I will still love bungie.<br><br><span class="mailauthor">Trainedrelic</span></p>

		<p class="mailentry">Hi employee or employees of bungie. I am sending this message to you to ask for the 'Recon Armour'. I know you get a lot of emails, but this one is different. Why you might ask because of my dedication to all of the HALO's. I have bought everything Halo from the Masterchief helmet to a pack of halo 3 cards. I am the Ultimate fan that deserves Recon armour not only because what I have bought but my endless hours playing Halo 3 Online. I have played over 2000 games.
So i guess what I am saying is if your going to give Recon Armour to anyone it should be me.
People say that Bungie has some glitches but you know what I say to them $%@# you.
Whoever thinks Bungie has glitches is going to get teabagged.
I love you Bungie and every employee who contributed to the making of halo's series.<br><br><span class="mailauthor">Dark Assassin39</span></p>
		<p class="mailreply">The ultimate Halo fan only owns <i>a</i> pack of the cards? That's pathetic. Could you at least write "Halo 3 Rules" on some of your underwear?</p>
