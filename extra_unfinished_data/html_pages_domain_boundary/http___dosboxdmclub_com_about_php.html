		<h2 align="center">About DOSBox Deathmatch Club!</h2>

		<p>DOSBox Deathmatch Club is a Discord community server dedicated to playing MS-DOS multiplayer games. Established by OpenRift in January 28, 2020 (before going public a few days later) because there wasn't enough places that properly offer the opportunity to play DOS multiplayer games with other people.</p>
		
		<p>DOSBox for the most part has been something that has a niche appeal for most people. Originally putting together patches for games currently being sold on GoG.com, designed to alleviate the hassles of getting a network game setup manually. When <a href="http://retro.classicgamingarena.com">Classic Gaming Arena</a> which originally was a browser-based service moved to being a desktop client for Windows, DOSBox Deathmatch Club would move their activities to this service, forming a partnership in the process.

		<p>In the early days of this community, only Saturday events were arranged until Janauary 29, 2021 with the introduction of Freeform Friday events, where we allow other MS-DOS games and even classic Windows games too. (Windows Games were allowed in April 23, 2021)</p>
