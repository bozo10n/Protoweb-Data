<strong class="text2">Client Updates</strong><br><ul class="text1">
<li>Shortened caption of option on general tab of configuration screen to default new game rooms to max players for game that don't have an in-game lobby (ie: games that require waiting for all players before starting) as it was wrapping under certain XP themes.</li>
<li>Added a caption with "Secured with" and a Let's Encrypt logo to the about screen.  For legacy clients (Windows XP and below) there is an additional caption after the LE logo which reads "and OpenSSL".</li>
<li>Added a link to the DOSBox Deathmatch Club website to the Help main menu.</li>
<li>Updated the DOSBox link to go to the non-secure HTTP website under the legacy clients (Windows XP and below).</li>
<li>Added links to the DOSBox and DOSBox Deathmatch Club websites to the Help menu of the Win9x/ME/NT4 clients.  The DOSBox link will only display on the Win9x/ME DOSBox Editions and NT4.</li>
<li>Removed the DOSBox SVN website link from the legacy clients Help menu since it's just a SourceForge link and is HTTPS only.</li>
<li>Updated the Hammer of the Gods configuration to now use IPX and NetBIOS instead of serial null modem.  It now supports up to 4 players.  When I added it back in 2012 there was an issue with it failing to detect NetBIOS, but I recently found this workaround on Vogons: https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?p=1290313#p1290313 and a patch EXE was released by the DOSBox team that addresses the issue with the game failing to detect the network before it tries to detect NetBIOS and the error about not detecting NetBIOS is misleading.  So NETCHECK.COM is now included with the installer and will be used for HotG.</li>
<li>The Win9x/ME native client will no longer copy and use netbios.exe for games flagged as needing NetBIOS since it's not needed under Win9x/ME.  This also includes the NETCHECK.COM file for Hammer of the Gods.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug wherein the games Worms United, Worms: Reinforcements and Hammer of the Gods would not run on the Win9x/ME native client due to their launch process requiring the actual game path in some of the batch commands and the config had hard coded paths of just C:\ which was ok under DOSBox.</li>
<li>Removed the command to start the Hammer of the Gods intro from its start up commands as it would sometimes crash and never start the game EXE.</li>
<li>Updated the CD image mounting and unmounting process under the native Win9x/ME client to execute the DAEMON Tools EXE directly from the client instead of from the generated batch file to ensure they run properly and to ensure the CD is available before the DOS process starts and is always unmounted regardless of what happens with the batch process.</li>
<li>Fixed backend bug that was preventing logging in from a client that had been auto logged out when the user logged in from another location with the same edition of the client.  </li>
<li>The game room info panel will now be closed when the game room list is refreshed.</li>
<li>Removed the location field from the main game room lobby list.</li>
<li>Updated the description caption panel to now display the name of a selected game add-on and if it has an author with "by <author>" appended instead of "Description" or "Description :: <author>".</li>
<li>Changed all references to "Game Customizations" to "Game Add-Ons".</li>
<li>Turned off the "Custom" tab on the user game add-ons screen.</li>
<li>Shortened the "Customization Name" field of the game add-ons list screen to just "Name".</li>
<li>Changed "[Available Chat Rooms]" to just "[Chat Rooms]' on the main screen chat room selection drop down.</li>
<li>Removed the type column from all game add-on lists and the filter drop down  selection list.</li>
<li>Removed redundant game room information from the right panel and updated the game room info button hint to read "View extended game room & server information".</li>
<li>Combined the multiplayer and singleplayer columns into one column named "Game Modes" on all the game add-on lists and the values for "Any" will now be "Any MP" and "None" will be "No MP" and if the add-on supports single-player "/ Singleplayer" will be added to the MP value, for example: "Deathmatch / Singleplayer".</li>
<li>Added the "Mode" column to the game add-ons screen under the Win9x/ME/NT4 clients.</li>
<li>Combined the "Playing" and "Players" columns of the main game room lobby list into 1 column and the value will now have 3 fields: "<playing count> / <entered room count> / <max player count>".</li>
<li>Renamed the "Custom" column of the main game room lobby list to "Add-Ons".</li>
<li>Custom control colors will now be applied to the find players screen.</li>
<li>The internal CGA server will drop timed-out client connections.</li>
<li>The internal CGA server will now check after a client authenticates for any existing client connections within a game room and drop them.  This will handle scenarios where a client crashes or disconnects ungracefully for any reason and the server isn't informed of the diconnection.</li>
<li>The internal CGA server will now send game room connection count (ie: playing count) when it sends its connection count when clients connect and disconnect.</li>
</ul></p>

<p class="text1">
<strong class="text2">Server Updates</strong><br><ul class="text1">
<li>Fixed issues with the local server manager when a local address is set.  It was unable to authenticate and was not trying to connect to the local address due to it always trying to connect to 127.0.0.1.</li>
<li>Updated the admin server started on port log entry to state it as a TCP port and not a UDP port.</li>
<li>Added a caption with "Secured with" and a Let's Encrypt logo to the about screen.  For legacy servers (Windows XP and below) there is an additional caption after the LE logo which reads "and OpenSSL".</li>
<li>Timed-out client connections will now be dropped.</li>
<li>After a client authenticates a check will be done for any existing client connections within a game room and drop them.  This will handle scenarios where a client crashes or disconnects ungracefully for any reason and the server isn't informed of the diconnection.</li>
<li>The game room connection count (ie: playing count) will now be sent when the server connection count is sent when clients connect and disconnect.</li>
<li>Beta builds will now use a beta update site when checking for updates instead of the production update site.</li>

<strong class="text2">Client Updates</strong><br><ul class="text1">
<li>Beta builds will now use a beta update site when checking for updates instead of the production update site</li>
<li>When saving the main form's size and position the horizontal splitter position will now be saved and restored.</li>
<li>Inviting a user that's AFK will now result in an automatic response that states they are AFK and may not respond right away.</li>
<li>Added option to disable accepting invites while AFK and an auto response will be sent stating the user does not accept invites while AFK.  The new option is located on the General tab of the configuration screen.</li>
<li>Added support for VDMSound in the Win9x/ME Native client.  You can configure the path to your VDMSound installation on the configuration screen under the VDMSound tab.  You now have the option to enable it at the game profile level and the user game level.  If enabling it at the game profile level all newly added games will have it enabled by default.  Existing games will need to have it enabled manually.</li>
<li>Fixed bug introduced in 4.1.30.4 where the user game add/screen would not let you save when editing a game because you cannot selected a game.
<li>Fixed bug in the Win9x/ME native client wherein an insufficient buffer size was preventing games such as Quake and Abuse from working correctly when connecting to each other or to a DOSBox client that setup the in-game multiplayer game.</li>

If the user chooses "No" it will display a message reminding them to run it before they join a game room.<br><strong>NOTE</strong>:  When adding GOG or Steam packaged games it's extremely recommended to do this since their DOSBox settings are not consistent and they use varying versions of mainline DOSBox which likely won't be the same as your default settings or the settings available to DOSBox Staging.</li></ul></p>

<li>Fixed access violation error when a game room update notice is received and the temp max players dropdown list box doesn't exist on the game room screen.</li>
<li>Added a modified ROTTIPX.EXE to the installation package for Rise of the Triad multiplayer games.

The EXE will not be overwritten in the game folder as it will be named CROTTIPX.EXE when copied.</li>  
<li>Rise of the Triad will no longer spawn a separate instance for the server now that a modified ROTTIPX.EXE is now being used.</li>
<li>Fixed bug wherein changing a dedicated server game room to a self-hosted game room was throwing an error stating the game room no longer exists.</li>  
<li>The notice that you need to start the game for your self-hosted game room to be available to other players will be displayed after changing the settings.</li>

<li>Fixed access violation error when changing between the game list items too fast in the games mods/maps list screen.</li>
<li>Mods for Duke Nukem 3D, Redneck Rampage, Redneck Rampage Rides Again, NAM and WWII:GI have now been setup to allow selecting map files and no longer has a separate maps setup/selection.</li>
<li>Corrected the about screen to no longer display the DOSBox SVN-lfn version for builds using DOSBox Staging (Vista+).</li>
<li>Game mods/maps will now be referred to collectively as "Game Customizations" and the list screen and menu items have been updated accordingly.</li>
<li>The game list in the game customizations screen is no longer a tree view and all mods/maps will be displayed in the customization list.</li>
<li>The customization type can now also be set when adding a new game customization, however, for all games except Shadow Warrior and Quake this field will either default to "Modification" or "User Map" and cannot be changed.  When editing a Shadow Warrior or Quake customization this field cannot be changed.</li>
<li>When adding/editing a game customization there is now a category selection which can be one of the follow values, depending on the customization type (ie: mod or map), "Mods", "Maps", "Mods & Maps", "Sounds", "Music", "Sounds & Music" or "Total Conversion".  If the customization type is set to "User Map" the category will be set to "Maps" and cannot be changed.</li>
<li>Added a "Type" and "Category" filter to the game customizations list screen.</li>
<li>Removed the author field from the customization list and moved it to the description header panel if one exists.</li>
<li>The custom column of the game room lobby list will now just say "Yes" or "No" and the info list will display "Custom" with "Yes or "No" instead of "Maps" and "Mods".</li>
<li>Reorganized the game room create/edit screen using a tab control and the main game room setup is now on the "Setup" tab, the options are now on the "Options" tab, and if the game had cusomtizations the Mods/Maps selection are now done on the "Custom" tab.  The options and custom tabs will only be visible if the selected game has options or customizations.</li>
<li>The new custom tab of the game room create/edit screen has been updated to have all the same columns for each customization as the game customizations list screen and all the new filters have also been added.</li>
<li>The mod/maps details panel of the game room/creat edit screen has been removed and the description field has been moved below the selected game customizations.  The original author, if one is set, will be displayed in the description header panel just like the game customizations screen.</li>

This new option applies to Doom II and Final Doom.</li>
<li>Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition mods can now be configured as "standalone" if they have files the same name as the base game files.  If the mod has a custom CFG file it can now be selected in the mod setup and passed in on the command line using -setupfile switch.</li>
<li>The custom cache will now cache the hash values of the zip files so that each mod/map can be shown as needing to be updated or not.  There is a new column in the list labelled "Update?" which will say "Yes" or "No" and any mod/map that needs to be updated will be colored red.

<strong class="text2">Client Updates</strong><br><ul class="text1">
<li>Fixed minor bug where the game dropdown list on the user game add screen was displaying newly added games at the end if the list after refreshing the game list in the game list screen or using the reset data cache function in the configuration screen.  The dropdown was not sorting its entries, but is now.</li>

<li>Added support for NCAA Championship Basketball.</li>
<li>Added support for Madden NFL '97.</li>
<li>Updated the mod/map mouting logic to no longer allow for some games to mount an X: drive and instead just mount the custom folder as an overlay.

<strong class="text2">Client Updates</strong><br><ul class="text1">

<li>Added support for Network Q RAC Rally Championship.  This required client code to generate the config file located at VAR\RALLYC.ZOG in order to config the CD drive letter.</li>
<li>Fixed bug related to game config profiles (ie: Steam, GOG) where a game with a DOS subfolder wouldn't be mounted properly if the subfolder was in the base folder in some way.  For example, Caramageddon's GOG profile has a DOS subfolder of CARMA and the base game folder is "Carmageddon Max Pack".</li>
<li>Fixed bug where a game config profile wasn't properly mounting the CD if the game base path was set to the DOS subfolder instead of the base path.</li>
<li>Added Strife GOG profile.</li>
<li>Added Quake GOG profile.</li>
<li>Added Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders GOG profile.</li>
<li>Added HeXen: Beyond Heretic GOG profile.</li>
<li>Added HeXen: Death Kings of the Dark Citadel GOG profile.</li>
<li>Fixed the Battle Isle 2 (Scenery CD) GOG profile with its proper DOS subfolder.</li>
<li>Fixed issue where the config file for Doom Engine games using DeHacked or DeuSF would not be copied back to the game folder after DOSBox closes.</li>
<li>Updated the configuration for NAM to copy its EXE back to the game folder in the event it is updated using the Build Mouse Fix and is saved to an overlay folder.</li>

<li>Updated Doom Engine games to update the game config in-place in order to set the autorun value and revert it in-place instead of backing up the config and restoring it.  This will prevent losing any changes made to game settings while playing.</li>
<li>The autorun setting for Doom Engine games can now be set/unset while running the corresponding setup program.</li>
<li>Added a right-click context menu to the game mod list screen's mod list frame.</li>

<li>Added Multiplayer and Single Player mod/map filters to the game room create/edit screen.</li>

<li>You can now delete the local files for mods/maps from the game mods & maps screen.  Individually or multiple at one time.</li>
<li>When running a game with mods or maps and any of those mods or maps have been changed by the owner their local files will now be cleaned up before re-downloading and extracting.</li>
<li>The local mod/map cache will now also be maintained when adding, editing or deleting from the game mod & maps screen.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug wherein editing a mod or map and updating using a new zip filename wouldn't update the filename of the local object leading to the client asking if you want to download the missing zip file when trying to edit the object before refreshig the list.</li>
<li>When adding a new mod or map from the game mods & maps screen the entire list will no longer be refreshed, the new object will just be added to the list.</li>
<li>Updated mod/map zip extract process to also remove hidden and system file attributes.  The mod called "Airquake" for Quake has a file named "DESCRIPT.ION" which is set to hidden and can cause the same issues as the files that were flagged as read-only.  If you have this mod downloaded you will need to delete this file and re-download the mod so it corrects the local file.</li>
<li>Fixed issue with LZMA decompression wherein it was calling the OnProgress event handler of its parent class multiple times when it should not have been and in some cases passing a filename without the full extracted path which could lead to an error being thrown when trying to reset the file attributes due the file not existing.  The map "$4,000,000 Map" for "C&C: Red Alert - Aftermath" was having this issue.</li>
<li>If the local mod/map cache has not been built the client will download a list of all active mods/maps and build the cache for any files that have already been downloaded prior to this update upon client startup.</li>
<li>The mod/map cache can be force rebuilt from the Game Mods & Maps screen by using the "Rebuild Cache" button next to the "Refresh" button above the game tree view.</li>
<li>Fixed bug with the game refresh button on the game mods and maps screen wherein if a node was selected in the tree it would systematically select all nodes prior to it consequently refreshing the mod list on every node.</li>
<li>Updated the game mod/map create/edit screen to perform the upload and copy to cache and extract process in a separate thread so it doesn't lock up the UI when working with large files.  If an error occurs trying to copy the zip to your custom cache or extracting the file the added object is now removed from the cloud.</li>
<li>Fixed the tab order of the controls on the game mod/map create/edit screen.</li>
<li>Code cleanup to facilitate a beta test build.</li>
<li>Beta build of the client will now use a separate user config folder to save its settings (.cgaclient_beta).</li>
<li>Beta build of the client will now work independently of the live client.  This will allow for running both the beta and live client together.</li>
<li>Updated the about and splash screen to display a label with "Beta!" under the title and version in the beta build.  The application title and main form will also have "[Beta]" appended to it.</li>

<li>Fixed bug wherein trying to run a single player game using a mod/map that had not been downloaded yet would cause an access violation (was introduced in last update).</li>
<li>Added support for Z.A.R. Mission Pack.  Note that this game is only in Russian.</li>
<li>Updated the message when trying to enter a game room for a game you do not have configured and your currently selected game profile's config type (ie: GOG, Steam) is not supported by the game.  It will now state what the current profile config type is and what config types the game supports.</li>
<li>Added support for NASCAR Racing.</li>
<li>Added support for NASCAR Racing 2.  This game required client code to handle the fact that it cannot be run from a root directory such as "C:\" so the client will mount the game to the configured path + "..\" then CD to the subfolder the game is in before running it.  If the main game folder is longer than 8 characters the client will automatically use the long folder notation such as NASCAR~1. (whatever the first 6 characters are + "~1")</li>

<strong class="text2">Client Updates</strong><br><ul class="text1">
<li>Adjusted how the DeuSF and Sound File buttons work on the game mod add/edit dialog window.</li>

<li>Added support for William Shatner's Tekwar.  Also included is a patched EXE which will be used in multiplayer named TEKWAR11.EXE and will not overwrite the orignal TEKWAR.EXE.  This patched EXE improves network reliability.</li>

<li>Added support for Assault Rigs.</li>
<li>Added support for Extreme Assault.</li>
<li>Added option to run a game up to the command prompt from the "My Games" screen.  It is labelled "Prompt" and there is also a context menu item named "Run to Prompt".  This will allow you to test and/or experiment with a game without auto running it and auto exiting DOSBox.</li>
<li>Added a "Create Room" button on the "My Games" screen and added a context menu item named "Create Game Room".  This will open the create game room dialog window with it defaulted to the selected game.</li>
<li>Game room creators can now set whether max players can be changed or not for temporary rooms for games that require waiting for players.</li>
<li>Updating your LFG status in the client will post to the #looking-to-play Discord channel.</li>

<li>Added an option for Blood mods to be set as "Standalone" mods if they are meant to override the game's base files such as the TILESxxx.ART files or any other.  The mod "Vodka" is an exameple of this.  This option instructs the client to extract the mod files to a subfolder for the mod and mount that folder as an overlay in order to load the mod files.  This will prevent this type of mod from interferring with other mods.</li>

It's finally here!  The completely rewritten CGA Client is now a complete desktop application and the website is no longer required to manage your games, create or join game rooms, etc, etc.  The dedicated server will now self register which will make it a lot easier to manage as well.  With that being said, there are a lot of changes, bug fixes and features added to both the client and the server and it's too much to list here, but everything can be viewed on their respective pages:

Yes sir, we're back up and running on our new 1 gigabit fiber connection!  We're not at full speed yet though.  I have a new edge router on order and it will be here next week so there will be some downtime after it arrives and I get it configured and pull the old router.  That's not to say that the new connection isn't fast..I'm getting ~350 Mbps down and up now and that's a huge leap from 50 Mbps down and 11 Mbps up.

That's right, tomorrow, Saturday, April 21st, 2018 I will be switching from Comcast Business (finally!!) to AT&T Fiber and upgrading from a 50 megabit connection to a 1 gigabit connection!  The switch should start between  1 and 3 P.M. central daylight savings time.  I'm not sure how long the outage will be but I will also have to switch all my domains over to the new IP address as well.  There is a possible 24 hour period of downtime.

So...I've re-added Worms: Reinforcements to the supported game list.  I was able to get a copy of the original Worms game and the Reinforcements expansion off Ebay before the holidays.  This allowed me to get it setup and tested.

Chasm: The Rift and its Add On Maps are now supported.  If you have this game and do not have the add on maps, head over the <a href="/downloads"><strong>downloads</strong></a> page and grab the 1.05 patch.  It contains the add on maps.  You may also need to grab the performance fix which corrects a bug in the original game which would cause the game to crash under DOSBox using newer CPUs.  The performance fix will also be included with the upcoming 4.0 version of the CGA Client.
</p>
<p class="text1">
Also note that I have removed Worms Plus: Reinforcements from the game list since Worms United is the combination of the original Worms game plus its expansion Reinforcements.  Worms United is also available on <a href="/GOG.com"><strong>GOG.com</strong></a>

Yes, finally managed to get Battle Isle 2 supported.  Battle Isle 2 requires the Scenery CD which added serial direct link support.  while it allows for up to 6 players over serial connections, I'm currently only supporting 2 for now as this would require some rewriting of the serial relay server, but it is a possibility after the client and server are released.  You can configure the game manually or based on the GOG.com setup.  Z is supported, but I had to make a change to the client to allow the client to build the batch file "Z.BAT" which the game requires you to run so it won't be available until CGA 4.0 comes out.  Which is getting closer.
</p>
<p class="text1">
With that being said, I have made a lot of progress on both the new client and sever.  Some updates to the server include, self registration and online status updating when it starts, actually being able to connect to your own dedicated server when it's running on your own LAN (can't believe I never noticed this one!!), dynamic IP update support and many performance and stability updates including a massive performance increase in the serial relay server (games such as Jurassic War are actually playable now).</p>

I have been busy with several other projects including building an MMORPG.  That one is a lot work of work, but it's been fun.  I've recently taken a break from that and have been working on CGA the past few weeks.  There are going to be quite a few changes coming that I have have been wanting to take care of for quite while now.

One of the major changes will be the client being converted to a native desktop application with all the features of the browser based interface, with plans for an Android version.  The browser based interface will be going away.  The client will still use the web server via the API I've developed and no one will lose any of their configurations or stats.  Right now development has been going very smoothly.  The server will also be updated to use the new API which will improve the user experience all around.  You will no longer have to register servers on the website after setting them on your local server.  That whole process will become easier and more intuitive and will allow for some other features I had planned easier to implement.

With that being said, in order to make everyone's user experience as consistent and enjoyable as possible, the ability to setup open relay servers will be going away.  Anyone wanting to run a server will need to use the CGA dedicated server.  There will be many more cool things coming, but I will hold off on those for now.

Thanks to everyone that has been using CGA over the years and stay tuned!

NetKeen is a fan-created, multiplayer Commander Keen game that runs in DOS, compiled from source code obtained by reverse engineering the Keen:Galaxy executables. The original DOS Wolf3D engine, along with the DOOM IPX networking driver were incorporated as well. Because it uses so much of the original Id code, the NetKeen feels very similar to the original Keen games. <br><br>

<li>Mac OSX now supported!</li>
<li>Windows and Mac client include a small menu program.  In Windows the shortcut is named "Classic Gaming Arena" and you have the option during install to add it to the desktop and/or the quick launch.  It is also in the start menu.  On Mac it is the default program run when the application is launched.  It is also now launched by default for the Windows client if nothing is passed on the command line instead of the website being opened.</li>
<li>Corrected the bug that played a "player left" sound whenever someone left any game room on the server the client was connected.</li>
<li>Added a debug mode option to the client configuration which will allow the player to see all the dos commands being run by DOSBox.  It will also pause execution before the game runs and after the game exits.  This feature works in multiplayer, single player and game setup mode.  This option is also configurable from the configuration program under the misc tab.</li>

Just wanted to let everyone know that the Mac OS version is all good to go.  I'm just waiting on a friend to wrap up some new logo designs for CGA so the Mac version has a nice set of icons instead of the DOSBox logo.  The new logo will also be used for the other platforms as well as the website.  This new logo will also be the start of an eventual website redesign.  The amount of data that I need to display on the site has vastly outgrown the template I purchased all those years ago.

So my service has been upgraded to 50Mps.  The Comcast tech even showed up at 9:30am.  So far it's awesome, except for the fact that my router is now unable to product the throughput needed.  I have spent most of the day tweaking my router.  I have managed to eek out between 22 and 25Mps down and ~10Mps up.  Needless to say I have a newer model router on order.

Ok, so after three weeks Comcast finally came out to finalize the transfer of my business class internet service.  Apparently they cannot handle a simple transfer without screwing it up.  I won't go into the details, but the tech that came out today, who was very nice and knew what he was doing, didn't even realize he was doing a re-activation on my gateway and not a new install until I told him.  I'm sure he was grateful as it only took him about 15 minutes to take care of everything.

Our service was down for almost 11 hours yesterday and about 7 hours this morning.  It's up been up since about 8am Central time so we we'll see what happens today.  From what I can tell there are always issues in Marietta, Georgia which is outside of Atlanta and our traffic here gets routed through there.  In any case, if the site is down it's because Comcast is flaking out again and we're sorry for the inconvenience.

Luckily I was able to bring the physical hard drive up in a virtual machine using VMWare.  Until we can get the server motherboard replaced you may experience some slowness with the site.<br><br>
The good news though is that our CGA Servers are on a different server so they will still perform as well as they always have.<br><br>

Also for all the Doom Engine based games you can now set game options when setting up a game room.  For example the map to start on or whether or not there should be monsters present.

<p class="text1">
<strong class="text2">Server Changes</strong><br><ul>
<li>Fixed a boneheaded error in the serial relay server code.  If the second player disconnected and reconnected a new relay thread was created every time.  This eventually made the server become very unstable and under Windows it would  go into 100% CPU.  Under Linux it would just seg fault and shutdown.  This was because I forgot to check and make sure a thread had not already been created.</li>
<li>Added some more error handling and logging.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p class="text1">
<strong class="text2">Serial Games Added</strong><br><ul>
<li>1942 Pacific Air War</li>
<li>Dawn Patrol: Head to Head</li>
<li>Dogfight: 80 Years of Aerial Warfare</li>
<li>F-15 Strike Eagle III</li>
<li>Flight of the Intruder</li>
<li>Hammer of the Gods</li>
<li>Detroit</li>
<li>Dark Legions</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p class="text1">
<strong>NOTE: </strong>Hammer of the Gods supports 4 players using NetBIOS over IPX, but unfortunately does not detect NetBIOS properly under DOSBox so I had to resort to serial null modem support.

DOS games purchased from GOG.com and Steam are now supported by CGA.  We have only added a handfull of games so far, but we will be adding as many as possible in the coming months.  This support also comes with a new client version: <b>1.4.1</b><br>
<p class="text1">
<strong class="text2">Currently Supported Games</strong><br><ul>
<li>M.A.X. (<a href="/?GOG.com" target="_blank"><strong>GOG.com</strong></a>)</li>
<li>Magic Carpet (<a href="/?GOG.com" target="_blank"><strong>GOG.com</strong></a>)</li>
<li>Ultimate Doom (<a href="/?steam" target="_blank"><strong>Steam</strong></a>)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p class="text1">
<strong class="text2">Client Updates</strong><br><ul>
<li>No longer creates a batch file (cga.bat) that gets copied to the game folder.</li>
<li>DOSBox is no longer launched with the cga.bat file.</li>
<li>All necessary commands needed to launch DOSBox, connect to a server and start a game are now added to the autoexec section of the DOSBox configuration file being used.  They are then removed.</li>
<li>For GOG.com and Steam games the version of DOSBox that ships with them is used instead of a preinstalled version.  The DOSBox configuration file for these games is copied to your home folder and used for CGA's purposes and deleted when the client closes.</li>
<li>IPXSETUP.EXE is now included with the client and will be copied to the game folder for Steam based <a href="/?idsoftware" target="_blank"><strong>id</strong></a> games since they did not ship them with this file.  It is required for network play.</li> 
</ul>
</p>

<p class="text1">
<strong class="text2">Website Updates</strong><br><ul>
<li>When adding/editing games in your user profile you will now have to select a configration type for each game before configuring the details of said game.  The choices, if available for a particular game, are "Manual", "GOG.com" and "Steam".  Manual is the normal configuration where you specify all details such as mounting a CD-ROM drive or ISO.  GOG.com and Steam only require the game path since the configuration is pre-configured in our database based on the game's installation from each vendor.</li>
<li>Added DOSBox, GOG.com and Steam logos to the bottom of the site.</li>

<p class="text1">
<strong class="text2">Changes</strong><br><ul>
<li>Your DOSBox path no longer has to be configured through the website.</li>
<li>The CGA Client now has command line parameters to launch it in configuration mode. <pre>--configure or -c</pre></li>
<li>In Windows there is now a shortcut added to the start menu named "CGA Client (Configure)" which lauches it in configuration mode.</li>
<li>The new configuration mode allows you to configure your DOSBox path and fullscreen mode.</li>
<li>The CGA installer will launch the client in configuration mode after the installation has finished.  You also have the option to not have it run after the installation completes.</li>
<li>All error messages that the client previously returned as a pop-up dialog are now opened in your web browser.  This change makes cross-platform development/deployment more efficient since it removes the need for GUI controls.  It also allows for better explanation of the errors as well as how to correct them.</li>
<li>The Linux version is almost ready for public release.  So far it is working just like the Windows version!</li>

</ul>
</p>

<p class="text1">
<strong class="text2">New Features/Changes</strong><ul>
<li>Added an admin UDP server on port 9666.  This port is used to PING and QUERY the server from the CGA website.  It will have other uses in the future.</li>
<li>Each server's online and connection status (ie: current connections/max connections), and name are now pulled from the website via this new port.</li>
<li>There is now only one log file.  It is named "cgaserver.log" and is now located under the "log" folder under the installation folder.</li>
<li>The configuration folder is now located under a sub folder named "conf".</li>
<li>The configuration no longer requires your CGA user ID, server ID or communicatin key.</li>
<li>Registering your servers on the CGA website is now easier than ever!</li>

</p>
<p class="text1">
So yeah.  If you do the math on the files that are no longer required.  The server is now one executable and a configuration file.  Pretty awesome if you ask me.  The reason for this is because the website communication code is now built-in and the UDP server code is also built-in (previously used SDL/SDL_Net for this which was being used from <b>ipxnet.dll</b>).<br><br>

This update of the client now checks to make sure your local CD path exists (CD-ROM or ISO), returns an error if it does not and exits th client.

This updated corrects the issue wherein the client will crash internally if the player's DOSBox paths have not been set and reports the error that the CGA file is corrupt instead of reporting that the paths are blank.<br><br>
This update also adjusts the order in which and update check to the client occurs.  It now occurs first instead of after processing the CGA file.  In the earlier versions of the client and the website the player's user profile was passed in the CGA file so the updater had to run after opening the file and reading the user profile path.  This no longe is necessary since the client looks up the player's user profile path.<br><br>
