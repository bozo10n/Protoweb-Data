<strong class="plaintext2">4.1.32.0</strong> - 2024/09/22<ul class="plaintext">
<li>Shortened caption of option on general tab of configuration screen to default new game rooms to max players for game that don't have an in-game lobby (ie: games that require waiting for all players before starting) as it was wrapping under certain XP themes.</li>
<li>Added a caption with "Secured with" and a Let's Encrypt logo to the about screen.  For legacy clients (Windows XP and below) there is an additional caption after the LE logo which reads "and OpenSSL".</li>
<li>Added a link to the DOSBox Deathmatch Club website to the Help main menu.</li>
<li>Updated the DOSBox link to go to the non-secure HTTP website under the legacy clients (Windows XP and below).</li>
<li>Added links to the DOSBox and DOSBox Deathmatch Club websites to the Help menu of the Win9x/ME/NT4 clients.  The DOSBox link will only display on the Win9x/ME DOSBox Editions and NT4.</li>
<li>Removed the DOSBox SVN website link from the legacy clients Help menu since it's just a SourceForge link and is HTTPS only.</li>
<li>Updated the Hammer of the Gods configuration to now use IPX and NetBIOS instead of serial null modem.  It now supports up to 4 players.  When I added it back in 2012 there was an issue with it failing to detect NetBIOS, but I recently found this workaround on Vogons: https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?p=1290313#p1290313 and a patch EXE was released by the DOSBox team that addresses the issue with the game failing to detect the network before it tries to detect NetBIOS and the error about not detecting NetBIOS is misleading.  So NETCHECK.COM is now included with the installer and will be used for HotG.</li>
<li>The Win9x/ME native client will no longer copy and use netbios.exe for games flagged as needing NetBIOS since it's not needed under Win9x/ME.  This also includes the NETCHECK.COM file for Hammer of the Gods.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug wherein the games Worms United, Worms: Reinforcements and Hammer of the Gods would not run on the Win9x/ME native client due to their launch process requiring the actual game path in some of the batch commands and the config had hard coded paths of just C:\ which was ok under DOSBox.</li>
<li>Removed the command to start the Hammer of the Gods intro from its start up commands as it would sometimes crash and never start the game EXE.</li>
<li>Updated the CD image mounting and unmounting process under the native Win9x/ME client to execute the DAEMON Tools EXE directly from the client instead of from the generated batch file to ensure they run properly and to ensure the CD is available before the DOS process starts and is always unmounted regardless of what happens with the batch process.</li>
<li>Fixed backend bug that was preventing logging in from a client that had been auto logged out when the user logged in from another location with the same edition of the client.  </li>
<li>The game room info panel will now be closed when the game room list is refreshed.</li>
<li>Removed the location field from the main game room lobby list.</li>
<li>Updated the description caption panel to now display the name of a selected game add-on and if it has an author with "by <author>" appended instead of "Description" or "Description :: <author>".</li>
<li>Changed all references to "Game Customizations" to "Game Add-Ons".</li>
<li>Turned off the "Custom" tab on the user game add-ons screen.</li>
<li>Shortened the "Customization Name" field of the game add-ons list screen to just "Name".</li>
<li>Changed "[Available Chat Rooms]" to just "[Chat Rooms]' on the main screen chat room selection drop down.</li>
<li>Removed the type column from all game add-on lists and the filter drop down  selection list.</li>
<li>Removed redundant game room information from the right panel and updated the game room info button hint to read "View extended game room & server information".</li>
<li>Combined the multiplayer and singleplayer columns into one column named "Game Modes" on all the game add-on lists and the values for "Any" will now be "Any MP" and "None" will be "No MP" and if the add-on supports single-player "/ Singleplayer" will be added to the MP value, for example: "Deathmatch / Singleplayer".</li>
<li>Added the "Mode" column to the game add-ons screen under the Win9x/ME/NT4 clients.</li>
<li>Combined the "Playing" and "Players" columns of the main game room lobby list into 1 column and the value will now have 3 fields: "<playing count> / <entered room count> / <max player count>".</li>
<li>Renamed the "Custom" column of the main game room lobby list to "Add-Ons".</li>
<li>Custom control colors will now be applied to the find players screen.</li>
<li>The internal CGA server will drop timed-out client connections.</li>
<li>The internal CGA server will now check after a client authenticates for any existing client connections within a game room and drop them.  This will handle scenarios where a client crashes or disconnects ungracefully for any reason and the server isn't informed of the disconnection.</li>
<li>The internal CGA server will now send game room connection count (ie: playing count) when it sends its connection count when clients connect and disconnect.</li>
</ul></p>

<p class="plaintext">
<strong class="plaintext2">4.1.31.0</strong> - 2024/08/31<ul class="plaintext">
<li>Beta builds will now use a beta update site when checking for updates instead of the production update site</li>
<li>When saving the main form's size and position the horizontal splitter position will now be saved and restored.</li>
<li>Inviting a user that's AFK will now result in an automatic response that states they are AFK and may not respond right away.</li>
<li>Added option to disable accepting invites while AFK and an auto response will be sent stating the user does not accept invites while AFK.  The new option is located on the General tab of the configuration screen.</li>
<li>Added support for VDMSound in the Win9x/ME Native client.  You can configure the path to your VDMSound installation on the configuration screen under the VDMSound tab.  You now have the option to enable it at the game profile level and the user game level.  If enabling it at the game profile level all newly added games will have it enabled by default.  Existing games will need to have it enabled manually.</li>
<li>Fixed bug introduced in 4.1.30.4 where the user game add/screen would not let you save when editing a game because you cannot selected a game.
<li>Fixed bug in the Win9x/ME native client wherein an insufficient buffer size was preventing games such as Quake and Abuse from working correctly when connecting to each other or to a DOSBox client that setup the in-game multiplayer game.</li>
</ul></p>

<p class="plaintext">
<strong class="plaintext2">4.1.30.5</strong> - 2024/08/29<ul class="plaintext">
<li>Fixed bug in Win9x/ME native client wherein setting a custom path for game customization files would result in an invalid path and not copy custom files to the associated game path and write a bad filename to the game customization's cache file.  NOTE:  You will want to run the rebuild cache process from the game customizations screen.</li>
<li>Added option to allow disabling the reminder to run a game's setup program before joining a game room when choosing "No" when asked to run a game's setup program after adding a new game for the first time.  This new option is located on the Games tab of the configuration screen.</li>
</ul></p>

<p class="plaintext">
<strong class="plaintext2">4.1.30.4</strong> - 2024/08/27<ul class="plaintext">
<li>Fixed a bug in the Win9x/ME native client wherein the configuration screen could cause an access violation when getting a list of network adapaters in certain scenerios.</li>
<li>The user game add/edit screen will now prevent you from saving if you have not selected a game or a valid path to the game has not been selected.</li>
<li>Fixed issue where a user changing their display name was causing the online user count in everyone else's client to be incorrect.  This was due to the client renaming the original user's display name to the new one when the name change notice was received, but then the client couldn't find the user when they disconnected from IRC.</li>
</ul></p>

<p class="plaintext">
<strong class="plaintext2">4.1.30.3</strong> - 2024/08/24<ul class="plaintext">
<li>Fixed type-o of the alert message informing the user a theme preset has been loaded successfully.</li>
<li>Added Adam Duzy's theme preset files to the installation.</li>
<li>Added Mode column header to selected mods list of the user game custom screen in the Win2k+ clients and to the available and selected mods lists of the user game custom screen in the Win9x/ME/NT4 clients.</li>
<li>Updated the prompt asking to run a game's setup program after adding it to a profile to be more clear it SHOULD be run.  If the user chooses "No" it will display a message reminding them to run it before they join a game room.<br><br><strong>NOTE</strong>:  When adding GOG or Steam packaged games it's extremely recommended to do this since their DOSBox settings are not consistent and they use varying versions of mainline DOSBox which likely won't be the same as your default settings or the settings available to DOSBox Staging.</li>
</ul></p>

<p class="plaintext">
<strong class="plaintext2">4.1.30.2</strong> - 2024/08/24<ul class="plaintext">

<li>Fixed bug related to game config profiles (ie: Steam, GOG) where a game with a DOS subfolder wouldn't be mounted properly if the subfolder was in the base folder in some way.  For example, Caramageddon's GOG profile has a DOS subfolder of CARMA and the base game folder is "Carmageddon Max Pack".</li>

<li>When adding a new mod or map from the game mods & maps screen the entire list will no longer be refreshed, the new object will just be added to the list.</li>
<li>Updated mod/map zip extract process to also remove hidden and system file attributes.  The mod called "Airquake" for Quake has a file named "DESCRIPT.ION" which is set to hidden and can cause the same issues as the files that were flagged as read-only.  If you have this mod downloaded you will need to delete this file and re-download the mod so it corrects the local file.</li>
<li>Fixed issue with LZMA decompression wherein it was calling the OnProgress event handler of its parent class multiple times when it should not have been and in some cases passing a filename without the full extracted path which could lead to an error being thrown when trying to reset the file attributes due the file not existing.

<li>Fixed the tab order of the controls on the game mod/map create/edit screen.</li>
<li>Code cleanup to facilitate a beta test build.</li>
<li>Beta build of the client will now use a separate user config folder to save its settings (.cgaclient_beta).</li>

<li>Added support for NASCAR Racing.</li>
<li>Added support for NASCAR Racing 2.  This game required client code to handle the fact that it cannot be run from a root directory such as "C:\" so the client will mount the game to the configured path + "..\" then CD to the subfolder the game is in before running it.  If the main game folder is longer than 8 characters the client will automatically use the long folder notation such as NASCAR~1. (whatever the first 6 characters are + "~1")</li>

This change makes cross-platform development/deployment more efficient since it removes the need for GUI controls.  It also allows for better explanation of the errors as well as how to correct them.</li>
<li>The Linux version is almost ready for public release. So far it is working just like the Windows version!</li>
</ul></p>

<strong class="plaintext2">1.2.3.0</strong> - 2011/11/04<ul class="plaintext">
<li>Your DOSBox configuration file no longer has to be configured on the website.  This will make setup quicker and easier.</li>
<li>The CGA Client now comes with a DOSBox configuration file which it copies to your user profile path the first time it is run. It is never overwritten and you can modify as you see fit. The file name is called cga-dosbox.conf.</li>
</ul></p>

<p class="plaintext">
<strong class="plaintext2">1.2.2.0</strong> - 2011/09/24<ul class="plaintext">
<li>This update removes cdiupdate.dll. The update checking logic is now built into the client.</li>
<li>NOTE: The update logic has also been updated slightly so previous versions will not be able to detect this new version. It will have to be downloaded and installed manually.</li>
</ul></p>

<p class="plaintext">
<strong class="plaintext2">1.2.0.0</strong> - 2011/09/22<ul class="plaintext">
<li>This update of the client now checks to make sure your local CD path exists (CD-ROM or ISO), returns an error if it does not and exits th client. Also with this version the cient is now executed using a custom URL protocol instead of a MIME type. What this means is an easier confiuratin and less chance for security issues since there is no file to download.</li>
<li>You will need to download and install this version of the client manually before you will be able to use the website to launch games.</li>
</ul></p>

<p class="plaintext">
<strong class="plaintext2">1.1.0.11</strong> - 2011/08/18<ul class="plaintext">
<li>This updated corrects the issue wherein the client will crash internally if the player's DOSBox paths have not been set and reports the error that the CGA file is corrupt instead of reporting that the paths are blank.</li>
<li>This update also adjusts the order in which an update check to the client occurs. It now occurs first instead of after processing the CGA file. In the earlier versions of the client and the website the player's user profile was passed in the CGA file so the updater had to run after opening the file and reading the user profile path. This no longe is necessary since the client looks up the player's user profile path.</li>
</ul></p>

<p class="plaintext">
<strong class="plaintext2">1.1.0.2</strong> - 2011/02/18<ul class="plaintext">
<li>The client will no longer copy the netbios.exe file and execute it for every game. Only the games that need it will this occur.</li>
</ul></p>

<p class="plaintext">
<strong class="plaintext2">1.1.0.0</strong> - 2011/02/17<ul class="plaintext">
<li>NetBIOS support.</li>
</ul></p>

<p class="plaintext">
<strong class="plaintext2">1.0.0.250</strong> - 2011/01/31<ul class="plaintext">
<li>The only change is that the client no longer requires the player's local user profile path passed in from the website. The client now determines it. It can no longer be configured on the website as well since it is no longer needed.</li> 
</ul></p>

<p class="plaintext">
<strong class="plaintext2">1.0.0.244</strong> - 2011/01/26<ul class="plaintext">
<li>Client will now check for updates and inform the player. The client will not allow outdated versions to run. This is to ensure there are no discrepencies between the server and client software.</li>
<li>Games such as Duke Nukem 3D that require a configuration INI file to be edited to set the network settings will now work correctly.</li>
<li>Virtual Networks: Client passes to the latest server a unique network id so that each game room is segregated from the others. Allowing data packets for each game room to only be sent between connections within that room.</li>
