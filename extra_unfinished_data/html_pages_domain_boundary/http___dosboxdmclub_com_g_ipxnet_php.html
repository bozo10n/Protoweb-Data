		<h3>IPXNET Batch Files (Connect Faster!)</h3>

		<p><b>Prior to using Classic Gaming Arena, community members and regulars connected to each other a bit more manually with the assistance of a dedicated IPXNET server called ipxbox, alongside various .BAT files included in various patches or packages and can also be self-created. .BAT files also helped run addons a bit easily without too much mess.</b></p>
		
		<p>Not only this makes connecting to a server more faster, it doesn't lead you to alt-tab just to look at the IP typing it down.</p>

		<p>1. Open up a text editor of choice, like Notepad.</p>
		<p>2. Type in the following :</br>
		<p><b>ipxnet "IP ADDRESS" "PORT"</b></p>
		<p>Example : ipxnet 127.0.0.1 10000</b></p>
		<p>3. Save the changes and close the file.</p>

		<p>There you could drop the newly created .BAT file inside a mounted directory (I store this at the root of the mounted drive and run it by typing the filename and pressing enter.
		<br><b>Example : fraggle.bat</b></p>
