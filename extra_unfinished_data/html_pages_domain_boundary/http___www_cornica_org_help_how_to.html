        <FONT FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="3">
        Cornica serves its movies in Quicktime format. Enjoy the all the videos & Quicktime VR fun on your old Macintosh.
<br><br>
If it's not working for you, check the following:
<ul>
	<li>Do I use an old Macintosh computer? (hint: If you have a Intel or ARM CPU, the answer is likely to be "no")
		<br><br>
	<li>Got Quicktime installed?<br>
		Does the sample video in your Quicktime folder play? If you don't have Quicktime yet, you can <a href="http://www.macintoshgarden.org/apps/quicktime" title="Quicktime at Macintosh Garden">download Quicktime</a> for free over at the Mac Garden.
</ul>

<h3>Can I use Cornica on e.g. an Atari, Amiga or Windows-PC?</h3>
Sure! All you need is a Quicktime compatible player. However, since I don't own any of these systems, I can't help you with it. Please refer to the documentation / community.

<h3>I can't get the videos to start streaming in my browser!</h3>
Depending on your browser (e.g. Netscape, Classilla, ..) you may need to copy the Quicktime plugin file into the respective folder in your browser's directory. You should find the plugin for e.g. Netscape in the folder of your Quicktime install.

<h3>Can I just download the videos onto my Mac?</h3>
Feel free to download them! Though we optimize videos for a fast start when streaming, you're likely to <b>get better performance</b> when playing it from your HDD. Also try the smaller, regular videos instead of higher-res PowerPC versions if you're on an official low-end Macintosh such as a PowerMac 6100!
<BR><BR>
Alternatively, you may also want to have a look at <A HREF="http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/fast-player">Fast Player</A>, a Quicktime video player with low-end Macs in mind!
 
<h3>Videos stutter when trying to stream them in browser</h3>
Check your connection - could be that your machine's ethernet is just too slow. Besides, those old browsers weren't made to quickly stream 100 MB movie files. You're better off simply downloading the movie and playing it locally in Quicktime.

<h3>The PowerPC-only videos make my browser (Classilla, IE5 etc.) crash!</h3>
Assign more memory to your browser. Chances are, you're try to stream a video with only standard memory setting. Click on the browser icon, choose "Get Info" and switch to the "memory" panel. Adjust both RAM settings. Alternatively try to download the videos and run them locally in your video player.

<h3>Videos are so damn small!</h3>
No, your resolution is that high! :-) try lowering your resolution to something you would have used during the 90s, like 800x600 or 1024x768. To me, there is little reason to run Mac OS in Full-HD. But I know, there are people ...
<br><br>
That said, Quicktime videos were intended to be "low-res" due to technological restrictions at the time. Almost all videos on Cornica are exported in high quality, resulting in file sizes that very few of us could have downloaded back in the day. So take the videos for what they are and enjoy that you're a witness of a true pioneer in computer video technology.

<h3>What does "PowerPC only" or "ppc" on some download links mean?</h3>
It means that this video has been optimized for playback on PowerPC Macs using the Sorenson codec. That means higher resolution & quality. It also means that it won't run on a 68k Macintosh.

<h3>Why are all higher resolution videos only PowerPC?</h3>
Lord, have mercy on your old 68k Macintosh!

<h3>Cornica is too small / big on my screen!</h3>
Cornica is optimized for 1024x768 on Classilla. The page looks neat on 800x600 as well.
<ul>
<li>If the Cornica page is too small on your screen, try to lower your resolution!
<li>If the Cornica page is too big and you have to scroll, buy VRAM / a graphics card for your Mac and set your display to at least 800x600.
</ul>

<h3>Can I book some banners / ads / editorials on Cornica?</h3>
No! We cherish the web in its uncommercialized form, created as a place for mankind to freely exchange information - and not as a tradepost. But feel free to <a href="/contact" title="Contact Cornica">contact me</a> and if I like your idea, I may endorse it - for free, that is.        </FONT>
