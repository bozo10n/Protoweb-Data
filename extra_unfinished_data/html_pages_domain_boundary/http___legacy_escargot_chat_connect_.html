<h1 margin="0">Getting Started</h1>
<h2>The Basics</h2>
<p class="text-muted">To get started in the chat-o-sphere of Escargot, you have to follow a few steps to get yourself in the right direction.<br>This doesn't require anything strenuous, and should take you a few minutes at least.</p>

<table class="w-100" width="100%">
    <tr>

        <td>
            <h4 class="font">Sign up</h4>
            <p class="font">
                <a href="https://escargot.chat/register/">Sign up</a> (main website only) for an Escargot account. It's easy, only requires your e-mail address and a username, and takes
                less than a minute. With this account, you are entitled to access on all of Escargot.
            </p>
            <p class="font">After you are done with that, follow the next step below.</p>

            <p class="font">
                Our <a href="/download/">downloads</a> page also offers select clients. The supplied clients on our site come
                in two flavours: pre-patched and/or unpatched. Pre-patched clients contain the software plus the
                <a href="/download/switcher/">Escargot Switcher</a> component and a modified version of the client's binaries
                that loads this component. Unpatched clients are the untouched versions of the clients that require manual
                patching with the Switcher component or in the application itself for them to connect to our service.
            </p>
            <p class="font">
                We recommend that users go for the pre-patched options we offer so that they can get connected to our service
                with no hassle. However, we are planning to offer our own solutions for accessing our service soon for people
                who just want to get connected without any setup.
