<h1>Connecting</h1>
<p class="text-muted">On this page are several guides for connecting to the Escargot MSN service.</p>

<div id="msn-pre4-7">
    <h2>Pre 4.7.2005</h2>
    <p>Patching these versions of MSN ultimately involves the registry, but there are three ways to achieve this.</p>
    <p>
        The easiest way to patch MSN Messenger versions before 4.7.2005, or repatch versions with the old servers, is to use the
        <a href="/patcher/">Escargot Patcher</a>. It'll patch everything needed easily.
    </p>
    <p>
        The second way to patch these MSN Messenger versions is to download a registry file we made
        specifically to get these versions to connect to Escargot, which is available
        <a href="//storage.levelleap.com/nina/clients/msnp/SetEscargotServer.reg">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>After downloading the file, double click it, and click "Yes". You should be ready to connect to our servers.</p>
    <p>
        The third, more advanced method is to go into the registry itself and add the key needed to connect to Escargot
        from MSN Messenger. Note that you must be aware that if you're not experienced enough with modifying the Windows
        registry, you can potentially corrupt your computer's configuration and potentially render it at an unusable state.
        However, if you're feeling courageous or can't use our supplied registry file, then proceed with caution.
    </p>
    <p>
        First, you must open Regedit. This is usually done by pressing Win + R, and typing <code>regedit</code> in the
        dialog box that appears.
    </p>
    <img src="http://static.levelleap.com/sites/escargot.chat/support/connecting-msn-step1-alt-run.jpg"
         class="mb-3 img-fluid" alt=""/>
    <p>
        In Regedit, navigate to <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\MessengerService</code> (foreword for people
        using 5.0 - 6.2, navigate to <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\MSNMessenger</code> instead). In the
        right-hand pane, check for a registry value named <code>Server</code>. If it exists, edit it so that it contains
        <code>msnmsgr.escargot.chat</code>. If it doesn't, create a registry value with the exact name and value mentioned
        before. Close Regedit after you're done with this process.
    </p>
    <p>
        After you're done changing the configuration, make sure MSN Messenger isn't running in the background. If it is,
        then close it. Launch it, and then proceed with login.
    </p>
</div>

<div id="msn-4-5-patched">
    <h2>5.0 and above (Pre-patched)</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="/download/msn/">Download</a> the version of MSN Messenger you seek. When you're done, if you're installing
        MSN Messenger 5.0 - 6.2, follow the registry instructions mentioned in the <a href="#msn-pre4-7">pre-4.7.2005</a>
        section. Other than that, you're good to go!
    </p>
</div>

<div id="msn-4-5-unpatched">
    <h2>4.7.2005-3001, 5.0 and above (Unpatched)</h2>
    <p>
        <i>
            Our new patching method for these clients is a bit advanced, so we advise people who don't know what they're
            doing to stay away from these instructions and possibly refer to someone that can patch them.
        </i>
    </p>
    <p>
        To patch these clients, you will need the <a href="/download/switcher/">Escargot Switcher</a> patch and the necessary
        tools to apply it. First, extract the Switcher DLL and base configuration INI from the downloaded ZIP, change the
        <code>type</code> value in the configuration to <code>msn</code>, and copy both files to MSN Messenger's program
        directory, where <code>msnmsgr.exe</code> is located.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next, open the <code>msnmsgr.exe</code> file in a PE editor and patch it with an import to the Switcher DLL you
        copied. We have a quick guide on <a href="/download/switcher/#import-guide">Switcher's download page</a> on how
        to perform this.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you're patching WLM 2009, then you should also copy the Switcher files to the directory where <code>wlcomm.exe</code>
        is located, and patch that in a similar manner to the previous file. If you're dealing with 4.7 - 6.2, then follow the
        same registry instructions in the <a href="#msn-pre4-7">pre-4.7.2005</a> section. You should be able to use MSN
        Messenger after completing all the steps.
