<h1>Escargot Switcher</h1>
<p>
    Escargot Switcher is a DLL component we've developed for patching supported clients. Switcher dynamically controls any
    appropriate internet requests passed and re-routes them to our servers. Currently our patch only supports Windows XP
    and higher, but this could change in the future to support older Windows versions.
</p>
<p>
    If you're patching a client by yourself, then we offer the base DLL and a configuration file you can modify for your
    targeted client. Note that when copying the configuration, make sure its file name is <code>&lt;module name&gt;-escargot.ini</code>,
    with <code>&lt;module name&gt;</code> representing the full name of the program you're patching, including extension (e.g.,
    <code>msnmsgr.exe-escargot.ini</code>), and the <code>type</code> value is appropriately set so that the client's components
    will be able to load the Switcher component when patched.

    <h4>Importing the DLL into your target application</h4>

    <p>
        To import Switcher into the executable(s) of your target client, assuming you've copied them DLL and INI files as specified in
        the patching guides, open the target executable(s) in a PE editor, one that we recommend being
        <a href="http://www.cgsoftlabs.ro/studpe.html" target="_blank">Stud_PE</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the executables you plan to patch, find the option to import the DLL, locate where you copied the DLL, and after selecting
        it import the function &quot;ImportMe&quot; from it and save changes. If you're using Stud_PE, for example, you'd open the executable
        you want to modify in it
        <em>
            (Windows 7+ users, run the editor as admin first as otherwise it won't have sufficient permissions
            to open files in restricted areas such as Program Files)
        </em>, go to the &quot;Functions&quot; tab, right click on the left pane,
        select &quot;Add New Import&quot;, select the DLL file in the directory you copied it in, and then select the <code>ImportMe</code>
        function and apply changes.
