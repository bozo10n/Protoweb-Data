		<p>Deathmatch '21 was the first and only (currently) tournament dated in August 21, 2021.</p>
		
		<p>Doom II with TWANGO1 was used for this tournament and was won by THEBaratusII who was administrator at this server at the time while also celebrating his 21st Birthday at the day of the tournament.

		<p>The reason we don't do tournaments is because of the commitment of having to make sure that the contestants arrived on time and one of the staff members at the time took two contestant's places due to not making it on time for the event. It's likely that the tournament would be the only one as the community is more focused on being a place for casual players to attend and have fun. But who knows, never say never.</p>
