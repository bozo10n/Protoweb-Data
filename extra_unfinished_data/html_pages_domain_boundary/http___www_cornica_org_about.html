        <H1>About us</H1>
        <FONT FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="3">
        Back in 2012 Youtube upped their Flash Player requirement. They locked out many otherwise perfectly fine working Macs. As an answer, Nicolas Bahamondes started Cornica with the aim of bringing video entertainment back to Mac OS users. As brilliant as the idea was, unfortunately, as short-lived it was. Hosting expenses and a hard disk crash ended Cornica 1.0.
<BR><BR>
Years later, Bolkonskij contacted Nicolas about bringing Cornica back. Nicolas agreed to use the name and also supplied our great new Cornica logo. Cornica is now live, including an updated look yet remaining Netscape 4.x compatible.

<h3>So you're basically a YouTube for the poor?</h3>
Cornica <b>does not strive</b> to be a YouTube clone. You won't find influencer videos here. Nor political stuff. And no commercialization whatsoever.
<BR><BR>
Cornica wants to preserve and keep Quicktime videos on the web. And it wants to be a place you can surf to with your older Macs.
<BR><BR>
After all, I firmly believe that <b>old Macs should not catch dust on a shelf</b>, but still be in use every now and then.

<h3>What content can I expect?</h3>
I created Cornica specifically to celebrate Apple and 80s & 90s tech (ok, early 2000's too for that matter). So expect a lot of videos about that from time and a few "converts" from YouTube (if their creators agree).

<h3>Won't hosting costs ruin you?</h3>
Cornica videos are served by the Macintosh Garden, the premiere Macintosh abandonware page. It's big, it's powerful, it won't go away. We thank the good folks at the Mac Garden for their great support!

<h3>Anyone specific you want to thank?</h3>
Yes! A big "Thank you" to Cornica's original founder Nicolas Bahamondes for letting me revive the project. Also thank you to 65scribe and the 8-Bit Guy on YouTube & Tuncer Deniz of Inside Mac Games for the permission to host and preserve their videos.

<h3>How can I support Cornica?</h3>
Spread the word in the retro community! Place a Cornica badge or banner on your website linking to us! And let us know so we can link you back:
